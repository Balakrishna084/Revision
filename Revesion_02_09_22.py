# 1.Decision Making,:
# Decision making is anticipation of conditions occurring while execution of the program and specifying actions taken according to the conditions.
# Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions which produce TRUE or FALSE as outcome.,
# Python has the following decision-making statements:
# *if statements
# *if-else statements
# *if-elif ladder
# *Nested statements
# --------------------------------------------if statement
# *if statement:
# if statement is the most simple form of decision-making statement. It takes an expression and checks if the expression evaluates to True
# then the block of code in if statement will be executed.
# syntax:
# if ( expression ):
#   Statement 1
#   Statement 2
#   .
#   Statement n
#
# Ex:
# num = 5
# if ( num >= 10):
#   print(“num is greater than 10”)
# print(“if block ended”)
# -----------------------------------------------------if-else statements
# *if-else statements:
#   From the name itself, we get the clue that the if-else statement checks the expression and executes the if block when the expression is True otherwise it will execute the else block of code. The else block should be right after
#   if block and it is executed when the expression is False.
# syntax:
# if( expression ):
#   Statement
# else:
#   Statement
# EX:
# number1 = 20 ; number2 = 30
# if(number1 >= number2 ):
#   print(“number 1 is greater than number 2”)
# else:
#   print(“number 2 is greater than number 1”)
# -----------------------------------------if-elif ladder
# if-elif ladder
# In Python, we have an elif keyword to chain multiple conditions one after another. With elif ladder,
# we can make complex decision-making statements.
#The elif statement helps you to check multiple expressions and it executes the code as soon as one of the conditions evaluates to True.
# Syntax:
# if( expression1 ):
#   statement
# elif (expression2 ) :
#   statement
# elif(expression3 ):
#   statement
# .
# .
# else:
#   statement
#Ex:
# print(“Select your ride:”)
# print(“1. Bike”)
# print(“2. Car”)
# print(“3. SUV”)
#
# choice = int( input() )
#
# if( choice == 1 ):
#   print( “You have selected Bike” )
# elif( choice == 2 ):
#   print( “You have selected Car” )
# elif( choice == 3 ):
#   print( “You have selected SUV” )
# else:
#   print(“Wrong choice!“)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------Nested statements
# Nested statement
# In very simple words, Nested if statements is an if statement inside another if statement. Python allows us to stack any number of if statements inside the block of another
# if statements. They are useful when we need to make a series of decisions.
# Syntax:
# if (expression):
#   if(expression):
#     Statement of nested if
#   else:
#     Statement of nested if else
# else:
#   statement
# Ex:num1 = int( input())
# num2 = int( input())
#
# if( num1>= num2):
#     if(num1 == num2):
#         print(f'{num1} and {num2} are equal')
#     else:
#         print(f'{num1} is greater than {num2}')
# else:
#     print(f'{num1} is smaller than {num2}')


------------------------------------------------2.loops--------------------------------------------------------------
# Loops:Loops are one of the most powerful and basic concepts in programming. A loop can contain a set of
# statements that keeps on executing until a specific condition is reached.
#
# Types of loop:
# *for
# *while
# +---------------------------------------------for loop----------------------------------
# *for loop:For loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence of items like list, tuple, set, dictionary, string
# or any other iterable objects.
# syntax:
# for item in sequence:
#     body of for loop
#
# Ex:
# for item in [1,2,3,4]:
#     print( item)

# Using else in for loop
# In Python programming, the loops can also have an
# else part which will be executed once when the loop terminates.
# Ex:
# for i in [1, 2, 3, 4]:
#   print(i)
# else:
#   print(“The loop ended”)
--------------------------------------------while loop-------------------------------------
# While loop:
# The while loop in Python executes a block of code until the specified condition becomes False.
# syntax:
# while( condition):
#   Body of while
#   Inside while block
#
# Ex:count = 0
# while( count< 10):
#   print(count)
#   count = count + 2

# ------------------------------------------------------------Loop Control Statements in Python
# 3.Loop Control Statements in Python
# *Break
# *Continue
# *pass
# ----------------------------------------Break statement
# The break statement inside a loop is used to exit out of the loop. Sometimes in a program,
# we need to exit the loop when a certain condition is fulfilled.
# Ex:
# num = 0
# while( num <10 ):
#     num +=1
#     if(num==5): break
#     print( num )
#
# print("Loop ended")
# -------------------------------------------continue statement
# Continue statement:The continue statement is used to skip the next statements in the loop.
# When the program reaches the continue statement, the program skips the statements after
# continue and the flow reaches the next iteration of the loop.
# Ex:
# num = 0
# while( num <10 ):
#     num +=1
#     if(num==5): continue
#     print( num )
#
# print("Loop ended")
# --------------------------------------------pass statement
# The pass is a null statement and the Python interpreter returns a no-operation (NOP) after reading the pass statement.
# Nothing happens when the pass statement is executed. It is used as a placeholder when implementing new methods or we
# can use them in exception handling.
# Ex:
# nums = [1,2,3,4]
# for num in nums:
#   pass
# 
# print(nums)
